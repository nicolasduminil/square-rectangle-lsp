# Square, Rectangle and the Liskov Substitution Principle

This test aims at proving that, as opposed to what this [article](https://medium.com/@alex24dutertre/square-rectangle-and-the-liskov-substitution-principle-ee1eb8433106) states,
the `Square` class can be an extension of the `Rectangle` one, without violating LSP.

In order to test:

## With Maven

    $ git clone
